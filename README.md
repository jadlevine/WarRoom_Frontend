# To Do

- [x] ~~Add New Game Form on Home page~~
- [x] ~~Display all Games on Home page~~
- [x] ~~Game Listings are clickable, navigate to Game (details) page~~
- [ ] delete game functionality/button in GameList
- [ ] flag images on backend (for practice)

- [ ] reloading page clears Number Sustained for each casualty, so a reload in the middle of battle phase would mess things up
- [x] ~~replace window.confirm/.alert with modals~~
- [x] ~~add flag images to render on front end~~
- [ ] add flag image reference (near top of game page)

- [ ] clean up styling!!!
- [ ] After cleaning up styling, add "Status Message" to direct user IF NECESSARY
