# To Do

- [x] ~~Add New Game Form on Home page~~
- [x] ~~Display all Games on Home page~~
- [x] ~~Game Listings are clickable, navigate to Game (details) page~~
- [ ] delete game functionality/button in GameList
- [ ] reloading page clears Number Sustained for each casualty, so a reload in the middle of battle phase would mess things up
